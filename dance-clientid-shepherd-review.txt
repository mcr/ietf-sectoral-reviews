>IETF working groups or external organizations, and would it therefore benefit

No sectoral reviews have taken place yet.
The IANA allocation will no doubt result in a review by TLS Expert Reviewers.

>such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.

None needed.

no such formal languages

>reviews?

No.

>What type of RFC publication is being requested on the IETF stream (Best
>Current Practice, Proposed Standard, Internet Standard,

Proposed Standard is appropriate for this document.

>Have reasonable efforts been made to remind all authors of the intellectual

Yes.

Working on this.

>Should any informative references be normative or vice-versa? See the IESG

All seem like they need to be normative.

None.

>Are there any normative downward references (see RFC 3967 and BCP
>97) that are not already listed in the DOWNREF registry? If so,

They will be fixed.

>Are there normative references to documents that are not ready to be
>submitted to the IESG for publication or are otherwise in an unclear state?
>If so, what is the plan for their completion?

Yes, DANECLIENT, which is in the queue for DANCE.

>Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? If

No.

>Describe the document shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section,
>especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document.

The shepherd found the IANA considerations to have inadequate text, and has
asked for it to be revised.
