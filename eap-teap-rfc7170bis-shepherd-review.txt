Document Shepherd Write-Up for Group Documents

Document History
>Does the working group (WG) consensus represent the strong concurrence of a
>few individuals, with others being silent, or did it reach broad agreement?

The document was the result of a strong consensus of a few individuals, but
they did not come to consensus easily; it took some effort for them to get
there.  There were therefore many things on which others could have objected.

The entire section on the PAC was removed.

> Was there controversy about particular points, or were there decisions where
> the consensus was particularly rough?

It took some time to get the wording right around a few rough points, but
much of the discussion centered around dealing with edge cases, where many
worried implementers might just get it wrong.

> Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent?

No.

> For protocol documents, are there existing implementations of the contents of
> the document?

As this is a bis document, there are implementations of the original RFC7170,
but there are points where there was not interoperation, which this bis
document mostly seeks to address.

> Have a significant number of potential implementers indicated
> plans to implement?

* Juniper
* Cisco

>Additional Reviews
>Do the contents of this document closely interact with technologies in other
>IETF working groups or external organizations, and would it therefore benefit
>from their review? Have those reviews occurred? If yes, describe which
>reviews took place.

A review by the TLS WG would probably be of benefit.

>Describe how the document meets any required formal expert review criteria,
>such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.

None required.

> If the document contains a YANG module, has the final version of the module

No YANG.

>Describe reviews and automated checks performed to validate sections of the
>final version of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code,
>BNF rules, MIB definitions, CBOR's CDDL, etc.

Some nits remain.

>Document Shepherd Checks
>Based on the shepherd's review of the document, is it their opinion that this
>document is needed, clearly written, complete, correctly designed, and ready
>to be handed off to the responsible Area Director?

It's clearly written, but is not quite ready (2023-08-17) for the AD.
The document is in WGLC at the time of this writing.

>What type of RFC publication is being requested on the IETF stream (Best
>Current Practice, Proposed Standard, Internet Standard,
>Informational, Experimental or Historic)? Why is this the proper type
>of RFC? Do all Datatracker state attributes correctly reflect this intent?

Intended RFC status has not been set in DT yet.

>Have reasonable efforts been made to remind all authors of the intellectual
>property rights (IPR) disclosure obligations described in BCP 79? To
>the best of your knowledge, have all required disclosures been filed? If
>not, explain why. If yes, summarize any relevant discussion, including links
>to publicly-available messages when applicable.

No IPR.

>Has each author, editor, and contributor shown their willingness to be
>listed as such? If the total number of authors and editors on the front page
>is greater than five, please provide a justification.

Yes.

>Should any informative references be normative or vice-versa? See the IESG
>Statement on Normative and Informative References.

Working on updating that.

>List any normative references that are not freely available to anyone. Did
>the community have sufficient access to review any such normative
>references?

None.

>Are there any normative downward references (see RFC 3967 and BCP
>97) that are not already listed in the DOWNREF registry? If so,
>list them.

idnits complains about some obsolete things, but they are TLS1.2 specific
things, so having RFC8446 not useful.

>Are there normative references to documents that are not ready to be
>submitted to the IESG for publication or are otherwise in an unclear state?
>If so, what is the plan for their completion?

draft-ietf-lamps-rfc7030-csrattrs is still in the LAMPS WG, but may exit by
end of summer.

>Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? If

Yes. RFC7170 will be obsoleted.

> so, does the Datatracker metadata correctly reflect this and are those RFCs
> listed on the title page, in the abstract, and discussed in the

Not yet.

> Describe the document shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section,

The IANA considerations section just updates all the 7170 references to this document.

>List any new IANA registries that require Designated Expert Review for
>future allocations. Are the instructions to the Designated Expert clear?
>Please include suggestions of designated experts, if appropriate.

None.
