Document History
>Does the working group (WG) consensus represent the strong concurrence of a
>few individuals, with others being silent, or did it reach broad agreement?

The consensus representes the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with
most WG participants being silent.  Given the very niche expertise involved,
this is not surprising.

>Was there controversy about particular points, or were there decisions where
>the consensus was particularly rough?

There was very little controversy.

> Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If
> so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the
> responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this

No.

This document is architecture document.
  Huawei has a prototype implementation of this architecture and specifically of the YANG module.

>Additional Reviews

The document deals with YANG and services.  While the L2 services used as
examples are not strictly within the normal IETF waist, the provisioning
these services has been done in the IETF for some decades.

> Describe how the document meets any required formal expert review criteria,
> such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.

no reviews were needed for the architecture document

>been checked with any of the recommended validation tools for syntax and

Yes: 0 errors, 0 warnings

>BNF rules, MIB definitions, CBOR's CDDL, etc.

>Document Shepherd Checks

yes.

no.

> Current Practice, Proposed Standard, Internet Standard,
> Informational, Experimental or Historic)? Why is this the proper type

yes.

yes.

Not a problem.

There are no significant idnits.

The list seems correct.

> List any normative references that are not freely available to anyone. Did

None.

> Are there any normative downward references (see RFC 3967 and BCP

No.

> Are there normative references to documents that are not ready to be

> If so, what is the plan for their completion?

The two documents cross-reference each other, but are going to the IESG at
the same time.

> Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs?

no.

> Describe the document shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section,

There isn't a significant section.
