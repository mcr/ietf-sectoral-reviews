Document History
> Does the working group (WG) consensus represent the strong concurrence of a

The group is very small, but the document represents the consensus of the WG.

> Was there controversy about particular points, or were there decisions where
> the consensus was particularly rough?

No controversy.

> Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent?

No.

> For protocol documents, are there existing implementations of the contents of
> the document? Have a significant number of potential implementers indicated
> plans to implement? Are any existing implementations reported somewhere,

Yes, there are existing implementations.

>reviews took place.

There is some overlap with SENML in the CORE WG, and those people are in
common.  The rest of the overlap is with entities outside of the IETF, and
some of those interactions are well underway (and complete), and others
likely will not occur until after the RFC is published.

> Describe how the document meets any required formal expert review criteria,
> such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.

Media type reviews for application/sdf+json and related Content-Format have
been requested.

>Document Shepherd Checks

The security considerations section has been completed since the first
shepherd review.

> What type of RFC publication is being requested on the IETF stream (Best

> Informational, Experimental or Historic)? Why is this the proper type

Standards Track is appropriate.

Yes.

Yes.

> some incorrect warnings; a rewrite is underway.)

No important nits.

> Should any informative references be normative or vice-versa? See the IESG
> Statement on Normative and Informative References.

A review has been done, and it seems correct.

> List any normative references that are not freely available to anyone. Did
> the community have sufficient access to review any such normative
> references?

None.

> Are there any normative downward references (see RFC 3967 and BCP
> 97) that are not already listed in the DOWNREF registry? If so,
> list them.

no.

> Are there normative references to documents that are not ready to be
> submitted to the IESG for publication or are otherwise in an unclear state?
> If so, what is the plan for their completion?

No.

> Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs?
> If

No.

> Describe the document shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section,
> especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document.

reviewed, seemed to be complete and included useful advice to Experts.

> List any new IANA registries that require Designated Expert Review for
> future allocations. Are the instructions to the Designated Expert clear?
> Please include suggestions of designated experts, if appropriate.

Yes.
Experts TBD.
